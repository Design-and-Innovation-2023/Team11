                <b><u>Design Inspiration</u></b> 
                <br>The primary focus for creating this prototype was usability, readability, and eventually, innovation. To achieve this, all essential aspects of the minimum viable product were completed before moving on to innovative enhancements. Key features of this prototype are the language translation and carousel- style explorer. 
                <br><br><b><u>How It Works</u></b> 
                <br>The landing page shown, presents course and program details. Users can easily navigate through the language options provided in the top navigation bar. Additionally, a user-friendly home button expands to reveal a dropdown menu, making it convenient for users to find specific projects of interest. Scrolling down leads users to a captivating carousel-style explorer. Users can explore random projects by swiping left or right, with each project providing a short overview and preview, giving them a taste of what to expect. When users come across a project they wish to learn more about, clicking on it takes them to the project page. This section presents comprehensive project details, including a longer video, detailed explanations, team members' testimonials, photos, and a link to the project's website for further exploration. 
                <br><br><b><u>Feedback & Areas for Improvement</u></b>
                <br>Feedback highlighted the need for a general overview of available projects, ensuring users grasp the entire range. The find dropdown also requires improvement to make it more accessible to users with limited prior knowledge of the projects. To engage audiences more effectively, the prototype should consider using captivating video clips instead of static landing page photos. Due to prioritizing feature completion before innovative enhancements, the visual appeal of this website falls slightly behind its sister prototype, which underwent concurrent development.

            between autumn and spring.The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs
            when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different
            dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Questions on project boundaries</b>
        <br><u>1. What are the primary objectives and goals driving this integration project and what is the key takeaway?</u>
        <br>Professor Jonathan shared that it would be for everyone to share what they did and be proud of their work. Moreover, it enables the students to showcase their project experiences during job hunting
        
        <br><br><u>2. What is the minimum expected outcome or project deliverables?</u>
        <br>Professor Jonathan conveyed that there should a working product rather than just prototypes. In addition, he shared that the website should have images and links while showcasing innovative capabilities by having an interesting way of interacting with the website.
        
        <br><br><u>3. We understand that novelty and uniqueness play a large role in this project. Aside from that, what are some optimal outcomes and end results the client would like to see as this project deliverables?</u>
        <br>Professor Jonathan replied that the engagement with the website is more critical as compared to the appearance

        <br><br><u>4. Are there any key features, aspects, or functions being sought after for the entire duration of this project? Rank these features, aspects, or functions based on their importance.</u>
        <br>Professor Jonathan expressed that the unique ideas are free for the team to propose

        <br><br><u>5. Are there any existing or similar products that have caught the client’s interest?</u>
        <br>Professor Jonathan conveyed to seek inspiration from art students to show the art works (our clients, other students). Moreover, he shared that he found a showcase interesting and would share the link with us.</u>

        <br><br><u>6. What sections or features do you believe should be prioritized to make the website informative and user-friendly?</u>
        <br>Professor Jonathan expressed that the team shall prototype a basic art sketch by the end of the week and then proceed to narrow down on the finalized prototype.
            
        <br><br><u>7. Imagine your dream portal without time constraints, what would this look like to you?</u> 
        <br>Professor Jonathan mentioned that the team shall explore various technologies to come up with a solution that is novel for him to review. 
            
        <br><br><u>8. Are there any specific accessibility requirements or considerations that should be considered during the website's development?</u>
        <br>Professor Jonathan expressed that the team does not have to accommodate everyone (e.g., people with disabilities). However, it shall be responsive to different devices and a disclaimer shall be added for devices that do not support certain 
            functionalities.

                <h4>Finalising the Prototype</h4>
                <p>Today, the team met up and discuss to choose an ideal UI to develop from after taking a day to draw up our own prototypes.
                    But struggle soon came as each member explained their thought process when drawing their prototypes and also explain the elements of their ideas. And it eventually became hard to choose a single ideal idea. So the team came to a compromise and decided to combine elements from each design that was unique pertaining to them to make the “final first prototype”, yes the irony in this is great.
                    After combining some of the ideas together, the team was happy with the outcome of it and learnt that there is never a “best” idea, just an idea that the group has together. Afterwards, we discussed it more with our partner on what we have developed to gain more insight into how the final product would be so that we can refine it even more.
                    After this, the team would focus more on exploring more on innovative interaction methods, especially their limitations over the weekends. #day4</p>

                <h4>Exploration for Group Photo</h4>
                <p>Today the team met up to explore for a location to take the group photo. there are a few requirements that the location has to satisfy:
                    Sufficient Space: The location should have enough room to accommodate 22 teams and the head of school comfortably without feeling cramped.
                    Proper Lighting: Adequate natural or artificial lighting is crucial to ensure a well-lit and clear photo.
                    Aesthetic Appeal: The location should be visually pleasing, with attractive backgrounds or scenery that complements the group.
                    Accessibility: The location should be easily accessible to all group members, considering mobility and transportation.
                    Safety: The chosen spot should be free from potential hazards.
                    Cleanliness: The area should be clean and well-maintained to ensure a professional-looking photo.
                    these are a few options that we have narrowed down based on the requirements</p>

                <h4>Exploration for Group Photo</h4>
                <p>Today, the team had finished the integrative thinking template and was leaning towards the SmartController JS. During the consultation, we demonstrated the implementation of both interaction methods, SmartController JS and Mediapipe before finalising the prototype based on which interaction method would be better for user engagement. Cohort photo taking is finalised to be done on Friday, 28th July 2023 @ 1230 at the location outside the Glasgow Gift Shop.
                    Our team has identified that Smart Controller JS is restricted on iphones but can be accessible through other android phones due to ecosystem challenges.</p>

                <p>Our team has announced the relevant materials we require from every group to include in the main website. Also, the cohort photo details have been confirmed and the team will be present to ensure a smooth flow of events. We have split the workload with 3 working on the main website, 2 on our website, and 2 experimenting with SmartController JS. Our next update with the team would be on Friday before the consultation with Professor for our progress update.</p>

                <h4>Problems Faced and Conquered</h4>
                <p>Today, the team is working on the landing page and “Meet the Team” templates, which are crucial for presenting our project professionally. We also managed to successfully integrate the smart controller technology into the website, providing users with a more enhanced experience. However, we faced a challenge when it came to making the website fully responsive. Thanks to effective collaboration and extensive testing, we were able to overcome this obstacle and achieve a responsive design that works smoothly on all devices.
                    One of the main decisions we had to make was choosing the type of controller to use, whether it should be a joystick or a touchscreen method. To make the best choice, we put ourselves in the shoes of our users and thought about how they would interact with the website, especially considering our Netflix-like layout. After careful consideration, we decided to emulate TV controls, such as Up/Down/Left/Right and Enter, as they fit the concept well. After implementing this controller concept in a prototype and trying it out, we confirmed that it indeed worked better for our site.
                    This experience taught us a valuable lesson about user interaction in interactive applications. It’s essential to incorporate something familiar to users rather than asking them to learn a new way of navigating. By doing so, we can create a more user-friendly and intuitive experience, ensuring that our website is enjoyable for everyone.</p>

                <h4>Getting There...</h4>
                <p>The team has decided on a work life balance of enjoying our weekends and working hard on weekdays to meet our soft deadlines as stated in the original contract. Over the weekend, the team went for the organised Edinburgh School Trips and had a great time. Today will be the grind to come up with a working prototype that can be used for consultation. Groups have started to submit their 10s trailer videos and group shots to us as well and it is a joy seeing all the effort put into it. As such, our team has promised to deliver a product worthy of the effort put into the respective works of our cohort.</p>

                <h4>Coming to an End</h4>
                <p>The team went for a consultation session and did a progress update with Professor Jonathan. We had our queries answered and even did a small little demonstration of the website with Smart Controller JS implemented as an interaction method. However, it was brought up to Professor that once the user is redirected to a new page, the connection with the Smart Controller would be lost. There are 2 ways of this:
                    Having the whole main website, including the cards, on the same page. Having the user scan the QR again once redirected to resume Smart Controller JS.
                    The team balanced and discussed between the 2 options and felt that option 1 would be the better choice as option 2 would result in more trouble and effort by the user to interact with their smartphones. Professor Jonathan also gave feedback that there should be a hint notifying users that they can scan the QR to activate Smart Controller and navigate through the website with their mobile phones. The team will work to implement the feedback and get a working copy up as soon as possible.
                    We have submitted our layout proposal for exhibition day to Professor and are looking at final changes to account for the emergency fire routes of ARC building. We aim to have the finalised layout before a walk-the-ground visit with Professor Jonathan and the building personnel of ARC.
                    Here is the first version of the proposed layout!</p>

We faced challenges in designing a webpage that sets itself apart from existing products, but the rapid ideation process and modified 10 for 10 method fuelled our creativity, leading to innovative ideas and prototypes. Embracing change and pushing boundaries made innovation the driving force behind our work.
                We are incredibly proud of the final product and the valuable lessons learned about creating remarkable designs through iteration and daring to be different. Our focus on innovation and design is now ingrained in our approach, as we strive to create more "purple cow" products with a lasting impact on users.</p>

Having to match mental models, prototype and search for a unique and distinct point was challenging. However, this enabled me to view design and features of a product objectively. Diving for a unique one-of-a-kind product was close to impossible hurdle that the team had to cross together.  
                                                I hope that the team has delivered on the expectations that was held on us. It was enjoyable doing through many prototyping methods, brainstorming and collaborate to come up with a better idea altogether at the wee hours in the morning. If choose one of the many key takeaways, it would be that good ideas and design do not come naturally. It is through iterations after iterations, which is what makes them valuable."</h6>

It is only after the first iteration of prototype that we has to do ourselves that I realised that I was poor at coming up with a good design. An all encompassing design seemed out of reach the first week of this program. 
                                                The modified 10-by-10, design rapid ideation allowed the team to quickly progress.

The team has a lot of ideas which were thrown out due to time and hardware limitations. Due to these constrains, the team had to ensure that an idea was innovative yet feasible with the resources available now. Even though it is not entirely new concept of interaction, I am really proud of our end results, and personally feel that it was a good display of what we could create in this short time span.

Making prototypes separately based on the modified 10-by-10 method was new and refreshing as we do not usually get the freedom to design a webpage on our own. As our clients gave us majority of the freedom, it enabled us to think out of the box and allowed us to be able to design a web application that we are all proud of. This taught me truly how valuable being able to walk away proudly knowing that the designed was one that the team has collectively came up with is.
                                                I especially enjoyed being able to review the iterative process of our team and all the others in a glance on the webpage. This gave me a new appreciation and understanding the importance of showcasing our best work."</h7>

The technical aspect was what challenged me the most as integrating technologies into a html page without a backend was not something that I have done before.

                                                On top of this, the design process was something new to me as the design process that I was used to was strictly based on Human-Computer Interaction design and deviated in the sense that it is largely a user centric design.

My perspective on coming up with a purple cow product is what makes this 3-week valuable. It was never occurred to me that a product standing out may be a key indication of a successful product.   
                                                After going through the 10 prototypes that we have collectively made though the 3 iterative design process, I learned that there is always something to be objectively improved in a design. As such, no design is perfect, and striving for one with innovation and eye catching is something we can do to come close to such a product."</h7>

Personally, I feel that the challenge for our team was to simultaneously make an innovative product that was at the same time still intuitive for users based on previous mental models. As innovation is to stand out, making it based on old mental models was counter intuitive to us at first. However, little by little, I am proud that the team managed to do so by revamping the concept of an old television remote and presentation clicker into a modern smart controller smartphone.  
                                                Regretfully, we were unable to create something that the world truly did not see before within this short span of time. However, I feel extremely proud of the end product you see on this site."
